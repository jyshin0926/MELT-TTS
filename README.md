# MELT-TTS
I have been researching controllable emotional TTS with multi-modal prompts and have independently authored a paper that is currently under review for NAACL 2025.
Through this research, I introduce an end-to-end Multimodal Emotion-Driven with Vision-Language Embedding and Prompt-based Modulation (MELT) TTS system which incorporates a disentangled emotion module. 
Furthermore, I propose an emotion modulation function that allows users to seamlessly blend and adjust emotional intensities.
